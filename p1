You are a financial analyst specializing in Phoenix Autocallable notes. Your task is to both extract the final redemption logic from the provided text and generate an Excel-style lookup table that maps the "FINAL LEVEL" to the corresponding "Payoff" value, using the attached business logic and reference table details.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: EXTRACT FINAL REDEMPTION LOGIC
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extract and output the entire language of the "Final Redemption Formula" as given in the input text. Include every detail related to thresholds, barrier conditions, and numerical payoff factors.

2. Break down the following payout conditions:
   - **Step 1:** The Final Value/Level remains constant across the template. This value defines the percentage at which the payoff condition is met.
   
   - **Step 2:** For each underlier, compute the payoff based on these conditions:
     a. **Condition (i):**  
        If, on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is equal to or greater than 80.00% of the Initial Reference Price, then the payoff is 146.5% of Par.
        - *Interpretation:* Since Par = 1, the payoff is 1.465. This value applies when the Final Level is equal to or greater than 0.80.
     
     b. **Condition (ii):**  
        If, on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is equal to or greater than the Barrier Level but below 80.00% of the Initial Reference Price, then the payoff is 100% of Par.
        - *Interpretation:* With Par = 1, the payoff is 1.000. This applies for Final Level values from the Barrier Level (set at 70%) up to but not including 80% (i.e. final level values between 0.70 and 0.80).
     
     c. **Condition (iii):**  
        If, on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is below the Barrier Level, then the payoff is computed as:
             Par * (Final Reference Price / Initial Reference Price).
        - *Interpretation:* With Par = 1, the payoff equals the ratio (Final Level ÷ Barrier Level). Here, the Barrier Level is 70%; therefore, for Final Level values below 0.70 the payoff is calculated as (Final Level / 0.70).
     
   - **Step 3:** The final payoff is determined by applying the appropriate condition for each scenario.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: GENERATE EXCEL-STYLE LOOKUP TABLE
------------------------------------------------------------
Using the above logic, create a lookup table with the following columns:
- **FINAL LEVEL:** Populate this column with values from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1 (i.e. 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0).
- **AS PER TS:** This column can be left blank (or used to reference the conditions/thresholds, but must match the style of the attached reference table).
- **Payoff:** For each FINAL LEVEL, compute the payoff as follows:
   - For FINAL LEVEL values **below 0.7**:  
     Payoff = (Final Level / 0.70)  
     (Format the result to four decimal places.)
   - For FINAL LEVEL values from **0.70 (inclusive) to 0.80 (exclusive)**:  
     Payoff = 1.0000
   - For FINAL LEVEL values **at or above 0.80**:  
     Payoff = 1.4650

The output table should resemble the following format:

 FINAL LEVEL |  AS PER TS  |  Payoff
---------------------------------------
    0.0      |             |  0.0000
    0.1      |             |  0.1429
    0.2      |             |  0.2857
    0.3      |             |  0.4286
    0.4      |             |  0.5714
    0.5      |             |  0.7143
    0.6      |             |  0.8571
    0.7      |             |  1.0000
    0.8      |             |  1.4650
    0.9      |             |  1.4650
    1.0      |             |  1.4650

------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
Your final output must include the following two parts:

A. **Final Redemption Formula Extraction:**  
   Output the full extracted language and step-by-step explanation as a plain text or in a JSON key named "Final Redemption Formula".

B. **Populated Excel Lookup Table:**  
   Present the lookup table exactly in the three-column format described (columns "FINAL LEVEL", "AS PER TS", and "Payoff"), with payoffs computed as per the conditions above, formatted to four decimal places.

Ensure that you only output these required parts and do not include any extraneous commentary.

------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------
- Extract the final redemption logic exactly as provided and break it down into clear conditions.
- Generate an Excel-style lookup table based on Final Level increments from 0.0 to 1.0 using the following payoff conditions:
     • FINAL LEVEL < 0.70: Payoff = (Final Level / 0.70)
     • 0.70 ≤ FINAL LEVEL < 0.80: Payoff = 1.0000
     • FINAL LEVEL ≥ 0.80: Payoff = 1.4650
- Format numeric values to four decimal places.
- Output both the extracted logic and the lookup table in one final output.

Please process the provided information and produce the final output accordingly.
