You are a financial analyst tasked with extracting and interpreting the final redemption logic from a Phoenix Autocallable note, and then populating an attached reference Excel lookup table with the correct payoff values. 

**1. Final Redemption Logic Extraction**
- Extract the entire language for the "Final Redemption Formula" as given in the input text. Make sure to include all threshold levels, barrier conditions, and numerical payout factors.

**2. Payout Conditions and Steps to Populate Lookup Table**
- The Excel reference table includes a column labeled "FINAL LEVEL" (or similar), listing Final Reference Price levels from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments (for example, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, …, 1.0).
- For each listed Final Level, you must determine the corresponding payoff value ("Payoff") based on the following conditions:

  1. **If on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is ≥ 80% of the Initial Reference Price:**  
     - The payoff equals **146.5% of Par**.  
     - Since Par = 1, the payoff = 146.5 ÷ 100 = **1.465**.  
     - Populate this value for Final Level values starting from 0.8 up to 1.0 in the "Payoff" column.

  2. **If on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is ≥ the Barrier Level (e.g., 60%) but below 80%:**  
     - The payoff equals **100% of Par**, i.e. **1.00**.  
     - Populate this value for Final Level values from 0.6 (inclusive) up to 0.8 (exclusive) in the "Payoff" column.

  3. **If on the Determination Date, the Final Reference Price is below the Barrier Level (e.g., 60%):**  
     - The payoff equals **Par * (Final Reference Price / Initial Reference Price)**.  
     - Since Par = 1, the payoff is effectively equal to the Final Level itself.  
     - Populate this value for all Final Level entries below 0.6 in the "Payoff" column (i.e., 0.0 through 0.59…).

- After you have applied each condition, the table will show a "Payoff" value for every listed Final Level from 0.0 to 1.0.  

**3. Output Instructions**
- Provide two outputs:
  - (A) A plain-text (or JSON) block containing the **extracted "Final Redemption Formula"** language exactly as stated in the input.
  - (B) The **populated reference Excel table** (or a representative version of it) showing the "FINAL LEVEL" column and the computed "Payoff" column, reflecting the logic in steps (1), (2), and (3) above.

If any piece of data or threshold is missing or ambiguous, indicate it as "null" or "N/A" rather than omitting it. Do not add extraneous commentary or fields beyond what is required.
